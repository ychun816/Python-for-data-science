# Requirements for Python04 exercises (ex00 — ex03)
#
# These exercises rely only on the Python standard library. No third-party
# packages are required to run the example scripts in this folder.
#
# Minimum Python version notes:
# - Uses `dataclasses` in ex03 which is part of stdlib since Python 3.7.
# - Uses `random.choices` which is available since Python 3.6.
# Therefore a conservative minimum is Python 3.7.

python>=3.7

# Per-exercise notes:
# ex00/statistics.py: uses `math` and typing from the standard library.
#   - Filters and computes mean/median/quartile/var/std — no external deps.
# ex01/in_out.py: uses `typing` and pure-Python closures — standard library only.
# ex02/callLimit.py: decorator example using `typing` — standard library only.
# ex03/new_student.py: uses `dataclasses`, `random`, `string` — standard library only.

# If you plan to run these exercises on older interpreters, adjust the
# `python` version pin above; otherwise no pip installations are necessary.
