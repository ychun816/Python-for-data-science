# Requirements for Python03 exercises (ex00 — ex04)
#
# These exercises use only the Python standard library. No third-party
# packages are required to run the example scripts in this folder.
#
# If you want to enforce a Python minimum version for typing features
# (e.g., builtin generic types like list[float]) use Python 3.9+.

python>=3.9

# Per-exercise notes:
# ex00: uses 'abc' from the standard library — no external packages
# ex01: uses 'abc' from the standard library — no external packages
# ex02: multiple-inheritance demonstration — standard library only
# ex03: simple calculator class, no external packages
# ex04: staticvector utilities, no external packages
