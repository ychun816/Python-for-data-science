#### From now on you must follow these additional rules ####
# • No code in the global scope. Use functions!
# • Each program must have its main and not be a simple script:
# def main():
# # your tests and your error handling
# if __name__ == "__main__":
# main()
# • Any exception not caught will invalidate the exercices, even in the event of an error
# that you were asked to test.
# • All your functions must have a documentation (__doc__)
# • Your code must be at the norm
# ◦ pip install flake8
# ◦ alias norminette=flake8
